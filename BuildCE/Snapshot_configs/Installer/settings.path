%APPDATA%\CubicExplorer\

; CubicExplorer loads/saves settings from a folder specified in this file.
; - Only one path is allowed.
; - Relative path works.
; - If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created when CubicExplorer starts. Parent folder must exist for it to work!
; - If this file is missing or the folder can't be found or created, settings are saved in the same folder as CubicExplorer.exe.
; - use [READONLY] in front of the path to prevent CubicExplorer from saving. For example: [READONLY]C:\MySettings\
; - Comment lines should start with ; character.
